# Movie_Recommendation_System

This movie recommendation system is based on **popularity based recommendation system**. I have taken the IMDB dataset, which has 2 files **movies.csv and ratings.csv**. The project works on flask. You need to input a movie name related to whom you want movie recommendations. It will give you top 5 movies similar to the movie you have entered. 

**Pandas dataframe. corrwith()** is used to compute pairwise correlation between rows or columns of two DataFrame objects. If the shape of two dataframe object is not same then the corresponding correlation value will be a NaN value. Note: The correlation of a variable with itself is 1.
